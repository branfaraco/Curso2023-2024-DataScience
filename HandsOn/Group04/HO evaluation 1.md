# Analysis
 - You don't need to define multiple URIs in your ontology. It would be as defining multiple ontologies.
 - It could happen that two individuals from different classes have the same URI because the naming strategy does not ensure uniqueness.
# Ontology
 - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
 - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
 - It is a good practice to use verbs when naming properties.
# RDF data
 - Verify that the class and property names used in the RDF data are the same as those used in the ontology.
 - Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
 - In the name of the street, the number is added.
 - Date values are not encoded properly.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.

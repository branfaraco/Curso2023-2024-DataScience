# Analysis
 - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
 - In the resource naming strategy, there must be a "/" between the class name and the identifier.
# Ontology
 - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
 - The XML Schema datatypes are not correctly written.
 - Some of the properties defined with strings as ranges are not strings.
 - It is a good practice to name classes in singular.
# RDF data
 - The RDF file is not a valid NTriples file.
 - Not every string composed by numbers is a number.
 - Datatypes are missing.
 - Datatype properties are used as object properties.
# Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.

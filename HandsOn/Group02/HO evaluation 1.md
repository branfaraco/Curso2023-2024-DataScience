# Analysis
# Ontology
 - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
 - It is a good practice to use verbs when naming properties.
 - Not every string composed by numbers is a number. It is correct in the data, but not in the ontology.
 - Add annotations to your terms so they can be understood by others.
